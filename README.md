## D308 â€“ MOBILE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT (ANDROID)

## Title and Purpose
The title of this application is VacationsRUS, the idea came from ToysRUS.
The purpose of this applicaiton is to showcase my Java and Android Studio skills by creating a vacation scheduler app. This app allows users to
input vacations and add excursions to those vacations. Some features include creating vacations and excursions with titles, dates, etc, editing and deleting those vacations/excursions and share vacation details via text or email.

## Directions to Operate
To operate this app, download the attached zip file, unzip it, and open in an IDE.
Build the application and use device manager to access the app.

## Rubric Aspects
There are two main pages of the app: the vacations page and excursions page. Clicking on vacations and excursions will take you to a list of all vacations and a list of all excursions, respectively. Each page has an add button that will take you to either add vacation or add excursion pages. Clicking on a vacation or an excursion from the lists will take you to vacation details or excursion details. These pages satisfy requirement C from the rubric. Requirements B 1-3 can found in the vacations pages. Vacations will show you a list of vacations, the add button will take you to a page where you can add vacations and vacation details will show the vacations details along with updating and deleting the vacation. Vacation details also includes a list of all the excursions associated with it, a share vacation menu option, and the remind me toggle switch. Requirements B 4-5 can be found in the excursions pages. The layout is the same as the vacation pages.
